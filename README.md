Tri Peaks Solitaire game: C++

This is a C++ project I coded, just for fun, to practice basic principles of good object-oriented software design, including the use of design patterns and writing clean, efficient code. I reused the code for the deck of cards, which includes the deck class and card class, from previous solitaire games. I also used a design pattern of my own, which I call an 'animation wrapper'. This class 'wraps' a card and handles the movement of a card across the screen, given the start point, end point, and time as inputs. This wrapper can be used to animate thousands of simultaneous animations. I used it to animate an interesting 'deal' animation and a winning screen 'cardburst' animation.
